# Module Context

This directory (`docs/`) archives project development notes, specific feature guides, and audit reports.
It serves as the historical record and knowledge base.

# Tech Stack & Constraints
- Format: Markdown (`.md`) exclusively.
- Language: Korean (User preference for documentation) mixed with English technical terms.

# Implementation Patterns
- Filenaming: Descriptive, uppercase preferred for major docs (e.g., `GEOCODING_STRATEGY.md`).
- Updates: Append new findings to existing docs rather than creating fragments, unless the topic is entirely new.

# Local Golden Rules

**Do's & Don'ts**
- DO update `DEV_NOTES.md` (in root) for high-level status, but detailed tech specs go here.
- DO NOT delete legacy docs without backing them up or confirming they are obsolete.
